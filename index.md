G'day! 👦🏽

I'm an Aussie system architect and consulting tech strategist.

I like to help organisations find a clear path through their information management & software development journeys.

I am enthusiastically focused on MS tech: MS 365, Dynamics 365, Azure, Power Platform, and really happy to share that passion with others.
