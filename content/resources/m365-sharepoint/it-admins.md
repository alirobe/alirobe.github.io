For data recovery, be aware of built in capabilities in MS 365: [dual stage recycle bin](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restore-deleted-items-from-the-site-collection-recycle-bin-5fa924ee-16d7-487b-9a0a-021b9062d14b), [OD rollback](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restore-your-onedrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15), [SP rollback](https://steveknutson.blog/2021/07/20/sharepoint-online-ransomware-recovery/), [SP version history](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restore-a-previous-version-of-an-item-or-file-in-sharepoint-f66dbda0-81f4-4d1e-b08c-793265c58934).

If you've suffered catastrophic loss in the cloud, and are having difficulty using Microsoft's built-in support; you can get escalated to MS via a respected partner within 14 days and you may be able to get the data recovered. You can seek out the support capabilities of well qualified partners with SharePoint/MS365 competencies on [Appsource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).
