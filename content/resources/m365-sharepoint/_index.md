## SharePoint resources

A collection of resources I've found helpful for working with SharePoint, organised by role and use case.

### Browse by role

<ul>
{{< resource-list restype="sharepoint" >}}
</ul>

### Contribute

If you've found something useful that's not listed here, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/alirobe/alirobe.github.io/issues) or [get in touch](/contact/).

I also contribute to the [SharePoint Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SharePoint).
