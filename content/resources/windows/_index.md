Not exhaustive, but a few useful links for Windows users.

- [Reclaim Windows 10](https://gist.github.com/alirobe/7f3b34ad89a159e6daa1) - I used to maintain this. It has 3000+ stars on GitHub, and it debloated Win10. I now recommend Chris's tool.
- [Chris Titus Tech's Ultimate Windows Utility](https://christitus.com/windows-tool/) - A brilliant utility to replace 'Reclaim Windows 10'.
- [Quick install](./quick-install) - Quickly install common tools on Windows - winget/ninite.
- [Keyboard shortcuts](./kb-shortcuts) - Some keyboard shortcuts you might not know about.
