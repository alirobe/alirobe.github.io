G'day! üë¶üèΩ

I'm an Aussie system architect and tech strategist who's been working with Microsoft technologies for over 20 years. I help organisations navigate their tech journeys - particularly around **Microsoft 365**, **Dynamics 365**, **SharePoint**, **Teams**, and the **Power Platform**.

I love solving problems and connecting people with the right solutions. Whether it's designing system integrations, streamlining business processes, or just figuring out how to make existing tech work better - I'm here for it.

### What I Do

I work on things like system architecture, information management, business process automation, and helping teams make sense of their Microsoft stack. I've built and led development teams working with C#, TypeScript, and various other technologies, with some background in DevOps/SRE and web stuff.

### Community Involvement

I run several tech communities and love helping people learn and connect (check out [Communities](/communities/) for more). I also have a strong interest in supporting Australian indigenous businesses and learning from indigenous culture.

If you're working on something interesting or need a hand with Microsoft tech, feel free to reach out - I'm always keen for a chat about tech challenges and solutions.
