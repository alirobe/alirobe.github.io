G'day!

I'm an Aussie technical architect and developer. I've been working with Microsoft technologies for over 20 years. I help organisations find a clear path to make their Microsoft tech work for them. This means I spend a lot of time working with Microsoft 365, Power Platform, SharePoint, Dataverse, and  Dynamics 365 CRM.

## What I do

I work on Microsoft platform architecture, architecting solutions, and helping teams make sense of their stack. I've built and led development teams working with C#, TypeScript, and various other technologies; and I have a background in DevOps/SRE and full stack development.

Right now I'm focusing on integration and automation using Power Platform, Azure Integration Services, and custom development. I also do a lot of work around governance/ALM, security, and compliance.

## Community

I run several tech communities and love helping people learn and connect. I also have a strong interest in supporting Australian indigenous businesses and learning from indigenous culture.

Check out the [communities I'm involved in](/communities/) or browse the [resources I've put together](/resources/).

If you're working on something interesting or need a hand with your Microsoft tech, [get in touch](/contact/).
